# Patient Systems
A prototype software that is a user-friendly and accessible interface for hospital patients.

This system will provide up-to-date reminders and notifications about each appointment and hopefully provide followup information.

Todo:
link an ACID SQL backend to a GUI provider menu
set up a separate login system

Where to start:
SQL?
UI Stuff?
to be updated.

Some ideas later on:
Make it look nice
Use voice recognition to take notes from the doctor or care provider
Display visual data such as charts or plots to indicate information such as health data, blood pressure?, dosage, etc.
Chat with a digital assistant
Create a timing/scheduling system to send out notifications

The goal is to make managing health easier for the patients while providing a convenient service for the doctor or care provider.
